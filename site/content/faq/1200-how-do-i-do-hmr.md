question: How do I do hot module reloading?
---

We recommend using [AtletikKit](https://kit.Atletik.dev/), which supports HMR out of the box and is built on top of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Atletik-hmr](https://github.com/Atletikjs/Atletik-hmr). There are also community plugins for [rollup](https://github.com/rixo/rollup-plugin-Atletik-hot) and [webpack](https://github.com/Atletikjs/Atletik-loader).
